Seedbank
========

Seedbank allows you to structure your apps seed data instead of having it all dumped into one large file. I find my seed data tended to fall into two categories:

1. Stuff that the entire application requires.
2. Stuff to populate my development and staging environments.

Seedbank assumes that your common seed data is kept under db/seeds and any directories under `db/seeds/` are specific to an environment, so `db/seeds/development` contains all your **development-only** seed data.

The reason behind Seedbank is laziness. When I checkout or re-visit a project I don't want to mess around getting my environment setup I just want the code and a database loaded with data in a known state. Since the Rails core team were good enough to give us rake db:setup it would be rude not to use it.

    rake db:setup  # Create the database, load the schema, and initialize with the seed data (use db:reset to also drop the db first)

To achieve this slothful aim, Seedbank renames the original db:seed rake task to db:seed:original, makes it a dependency for all the Seedbank seeds and adds a new db:seed task that loads all the common seeds in db/seeds plus all the seeds for the current Rails environment.

Although originally built for Rails, Seedbank can work stand alone thanks to Aleksey Ivanov.

Example
=======

Seedbank seeds follow this structure;

    db/seeds/
      bar.seeds.rb
      development/
        users.seeds.rb
      foo.seeds.rb

This would generate the following Rake tasks

    rake db:seed                    # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb, db/seeds/*.seeds.rb and db/seeds/ENVIRONMENT/*.seeds.rb. ENVIRONMENT is the current environment in Rails.env.
    rake db:seed:bar                # Load the seed data from db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb
    rake db:seed:common             # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb and db/seeds/*.seeds.rb.
    rake db:seed:development        # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb, db/seeds/*.seeds.rb and db/seeds/development/*.seeds.rb.
    rake db:seed:development:users  # Load the seed data from db/seeds/development/users.seeds.rb
    rake db:seed:original           # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb

Therefore, assuming `RAILS_ENV` is not set or it is "development":

    $ rake db:seed

will load the seeds in `db/seeds.rb`, `db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb`, `db/seeds/foo.seeds.rb` and `db/seeds/development/users.seeds.rb`. Whereas, setting the `RAILS_ENV` variable, like so:

    $ RAILS_ENV=production rake db:seed

will load the seeds in `db/seeds.rb`, `db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb` and `db/seeds/foo.seeds.rb`.

Installation
============

Seedbank > 0.5.0 uses refinements and no longer supports rubies below 2.x. If you are using an older Ruby you'll have to stick with 0.4.0 and below.

I have also dropped support for Rubinius and JRuby. I'm happy to accept pull requests for them, but don't have the time to hack together the test environment. If you want to contribute, please ensure that he travis.yml is in line as it's the only way I will test these two environments.

### Rails 5.x

Seedbank has not been updated to work with Rails 5. I've used it with 5.x apps and am working on a new version specifically for 5.x. Other people are also reporting using it with no problems.

### Rails 4.x and above

Add the seedbank gem to your Gemfile.  In Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "seedbank"
```

That's it!

### Non Rails apps

Although originally built for Rails, Seedbank should work fine in other environments such as Padrino, Grape or the new new hotness.

Add the seedbank gem to your Gemfile.  In Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "seedbank"
```

In your Rakefile create a `db:seed:setup` task that configures your database layer before the seed files are executed.

The example below is for an application using DRY-rb and ROM to provide database access, your setup will probably be different. In Rakefile:

```ruby
namespace :db do
  namespace :seed do
    task :setup do
      # require our DRY container and boot our repositories
      require 'container'
      Application.boot!(:repository)
    end
  end
end

require 'seedbank'
Seedbank.load_tasks
```

### Rails 3.x

Seedbank 0.5.0 onwards is no longer tested against Rails 3.x, that isn't to say it will not work. I
will not fix issues against Rails 3.x, but will accept tested pull requests.

### Rails 2.x

Seedbank hasn't supported Rails 2.x for some time. You'll need to use the 0.2.1 version. In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "seedbank", '~> 0.2.1'
```

Then in the bottom of your application's Rakefile:

```ruby
require 'seedbank'
Seedbank.load_tasks if defined?(Seedbank)
```

If you vendor the gem you'll need to change the require to the specific path.

Usage
=====

Seeds files are just plain old Ruby executed in your application environment so anything you could type into the console will work in your seeds. Seeds files have to be named with the '.seeds.rb' extension.

db/seeds/companies.seeds.rb
```ruby
Company.find_or_create_by_name('Hatch', :url => 'http://thisishatch.co.uk' )
```

The seed files under db/seeds are run first in alphanumeric order followed by the ones in the db/seeds/RAILS_ENV. You can add dependencies to your seed files
to enforce the run order. for example;

db/seeds/users.seeds.rb
```ruby
after :companies do
  company = Company.find_by_name('Hatch')
  company.users.create(:first_name => 'James', :last_name => 'McCarthy')
end
```

db/seeds/projects.seeds.rb
```ruby
after :companies do
  company = Company.find_by_name('Hatch')
  company.projects.create(:title => 'Seedbank')
end
```

db/seeds/tasks.seeds.rb
```ruby
after :projects, :users do
  project = Project.find_by_name('Seedbank')
  user = User.find_by_first_name_and_last_name('James', 'McCarthy')
  project.tasks.create(:owner => user, :title => 'Document seed dependencies in the README.md')
end
```

If the dependencies are in one of the environment folders, you need to namespace the parent task:

db/seeds/development/users.seeds.rb
```ruby
after "development:companies" do
  company = Company.find_by_name('Hatch')
  company.users.create(:first_name => 'James', :last_name => 'McCarthy')
end
```

*Note* - If you experience any errors like `Don't know how to build task 'db:seed:users'`. Ensure you are specifying `after 'development:companies'` like the above example. This is the usual culprit (YMMV).

### Defining and using methods

As seed files are evaluated within a single runner in dependency order, any methods defined earlier in the run will be available across dependent tasks. I
recommend keeping method definitions in the seed file that uses them. Alternatively if you have many common methods, put them into a module and extend the
runner with the module.

db/seeds/support.rb
```ruby
module Support
  def notify(filename)
    puts "Seeding: #{filename}"
  end
end
```

db/seeds/common.seeds.rb
```ruby
require_relative 'support'
extend Support

notify(__FILE__)
```

To keep this dry you could make the seeds dependent on a support seed that extends the runner.

db/seeds/users.seeds.rb
```ruby
after :common do
  notify(__FILE__)
end
```

Note on Patches/Pull Request
============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore it when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.  Bonus points for topic branches.
